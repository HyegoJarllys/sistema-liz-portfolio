**API Overview**

Sistema LIZ exposes a single, purpose-built conversational endpoint designed for integration with web, mobile, or messaging platforms.

The API is intentionally minimal:

One primary endpoint

Clear request/response contracts

Explicit error semantics

This simplicity reduces integration errors and operational complexity.

**Base Endpoint**
POST https://<backend-host>/chat

The actual production URL is intentionally omitted.

**Request Specification**

**Headers**
Header	Value
Content-Type	application/json

**Request Body**
Field	Type	Required	Description
message	string	Yes	User query or request
user_id	string	Yes	Anonymous or hashed identifier

Example Request:
{
  "message": "How can I submit a formal service request?",
  "user_id": "anonymous_user_001"
}
**Response Specification**
Success Response (200)
{
  "response": "According to the official service guidelines, formal requests must be submitted through the institutional portal.",
  "sources": [
    "Public Service Manual v2.1"
  ]
}
Response Fields
Field	    Type    	Description
response	string	    Grounded response generated by the system
sources	    array	    Documents used to support the answer

**Error Handling**

The API follows standard HTTP conventions.

Error       Codes
Status	    Description
400	        Invalid request or missing fields
429	        Rate limit exceeded
500	        Internal server error
503	        Temporary service unavailability

**Example Error Response**
{
  "error": "Service temporarily unavailable. Please retry later."
}

**Rate Limiting & Constraints**

Request payload size limits enforced

Rate limits applied per client or integration

Defensive defaults to protect system stability

Exact limits are environment-specific and not exposed publicly.

**Idempotency & State**

The API is stateless

Each request is processed independently

No conversational state is persisted server-side

Any conversational context must be managed by the client application.

**Security Considerations**

No authentication details exposed in this repository

Production deployments rely on secure identity mechanisms

User identifiers must not contain personal data

**Versioning Strategy**

Backward-compatible changes preferred

Contract-breaking changes require versioned endpoints

API documentation reflects the currently supported version

**Intended Integrations**

Web-based chat interfaces

Mobile applications

Messaging platforms (via adapter layers)
