**Reporting Security Issues**

If you believe you have found a security-related issue in this repository:

Do not open a public issue describing the problem in detail

Do not attempt to exploit the issue

Instead, please contact the author directly to report the concern responsibly.

**Responsible Disclosure**

This repository follows responsible disclosure principles:

Security issues should be reported privately

Adequate time will be taken to assess and address the concern

Public disclosure should only occur after explicit authorization

**Production Disclaimer**

This repository does not represent a full production deployment.

Any production system based on this work:

Requires additional security hardening

Must implement environment-specific controls

Should undergo proper security review and testing

The author assumes no responsibility for deployments derived from this public material.

**Security by Design**

Although sanitized, the documentation reflects design principles commonly applied in production systems, including:

Least privilege

Separation of concerns

Isolation of trust boundaries

Privacy-first data handling

Implementation details are intentionally abstracted.

**Final Note**

Security is a continuous process.
This document exists to clarify intent, boundaries, and expectations, not to provide operational guarantees.
