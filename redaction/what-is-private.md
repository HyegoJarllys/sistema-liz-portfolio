# What is Private (Not Included in This Repository)

This repository is a **portfolio and architectural showcase**.  
To protect intellectual property and production security, the following assets are **intentionally excluded**.

## Excluded by Design

### Proprietary Logic
- Full prompt templates and system instructions
- Domain-specific reasoning rules and guardrails
- Classification heuristics and internal scoring logic

### Production Configuration
- Real endpoints, project IDs, datastore IDs
- Service accounts, IAM bindings, quotas
- Environment variables, secrets, API keys

### Client/Institution-Specific Content
- Real documents, datasets, or knowledge bases
- Municipal/institution-specific workflows, policies, or sensitive documents
- Any identifiers that could reveal customers or deployments

### Internal Tooling
- Debug scripts, deployment automation, private runbooks
- Monitoring alerts configuration tied to real resources

## Why This Matters
These exclusions allow reviewers to evaluate:
- architecture and trade-offs
- production thinking
- security and governance posture

…without enabling unauthorized reuse or deployment.

## Requesting a Private Review
A private technical walkthrough can be provided under appropriate terms.
